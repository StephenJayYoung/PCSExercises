//inheritance let's you share the same code between similar types

//when there are objects with similar properties and behaviors, 
//making constructor functions for each of them is a lot fo work,
//so we use the prototype chain

//when you access a property or method on an object, the javascript interpreter checks
//if it's directly on the instance. If it's not, it will check the prototype. If it's 
//not there, it will check the next prototype up the chain
//
